**The SBML Test Suite**
=======================

The **SBML Test Suite** is a conformance testing system for [SBML](http://sbml.org). It allows developers and users to test the degree and correctness of [SBML](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications) support provided in an SBML-compatible software package.  The SBML Test Suite consists of (1) a collection of SBML models, each with associated simulated results where appropriate; (2) a testing framework for running software tools through the suite; and (3) basic documentation on the test cases and the use of the suite.

The individual subdirectories you will find here contain the different releases of the SBML Test Suite test cases and the Test Runner.
