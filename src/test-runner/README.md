Standalone test runners for the SBML Test Suite
==============================================

This directory contains standalone applications and libraries for running applications through the SBML Test Suite.  There are different subdirectories for different components and runners.  The most popular is the SBML Test Runner with a graphical user interface (GUI) in [testsuite-ui](testsuite-ui).  To build the GUI version of the SBML Test Runner, please read the [README.md](testsuite-ui/README.md) file in the [testsuite-ui](testsuite-ui) subdirectory.

The subdirectory [testsuite-core](testsuite-core) contains core components used by the SBML Test Runner and a previously-available web-based system.

The subdirectory [testsuite-web](testsuite-web) contains code for a web-based system that is no longer supported (as of 2016).


‚ò∫ Acknowledgments
-----------------

The first version of the SBML Test Suite and a script to run applications was developed by Andrew Finney in the early 2000's.  A second generation of the SBML Test Runner was written by Kimberley Begley and Michael Hucka in the late 2000's.  The current (now third generation) of the SBML Test Runner was fashioned after [compare-results](https://sourceforge.net/p/compare-results/wiki/Home/), a WIN32 application previously written by Frank T. Bergmann in .NET.

Funding for the continued development of the core of the SBML Test Suite currently comes from the [National Institute of General Medical Sciences](https://www.nigms.nih.gov) via grant NIH R01070923 (Principal Investigator: Michael Hucka).
